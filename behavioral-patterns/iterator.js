/**
 * **Pattern**: Iterator
 * **Category**: Behavioral Pattern
 * **Description**:
 * The Iterator pattern provides a way to access the elements of a collection sequentially without exposing
 * its underlying representation. It defines a standard interface to traverse a collection, allowing
 * flexibility and consistency.
 *
 * **Real-Life Example**:
 * Think of a playlist in a music player. The playlist might contain songs from different albums, but you
 * need a consistent way to iterate through and play each song, one after another.

/**
 * Explanation:
 * 1. **Playlist (Collection)**:
 *    - The `Playlist` class holds a collection of songs and provides a method to get an iterator for the collection.
 *
 * 2. **PlaylistIterator (Iterator)**:
 *    - The `PlaylistIterator` class defines how to traverse the playlist. It provides methods like `next` to get the next song and `hasNext` to check if there are more songs left.
 *
 * 3. **Client Code**:
 *    - The client code uses the iterator to traverse through the playlist without needing to know the details of how the playlist is structured internally.
 *
 * **Real-Life Analogy**:
 * Imagine a playlist in a music app. Even if the songs come from different albums or sources, you want to play them in a consistent sequence, and thatâ€™s what the iterator helps achieve.
