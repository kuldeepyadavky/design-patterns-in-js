/**
 * **Pattern**: Builder
 * **Category**: Creational Pattern
 * **Description**:
 * The Builder Pattern constructs complex objects step-by-step by separating the construction process
 * from the final representation. It allows for more controlled and flexible object creation, especially
 * when there are multiple ways to build an object or when the object has many configuration options.
 *
 * **Real-Life Example**:
 * Consider a scenario where you want to build a custom pizza. You specify the crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings
 * step-by-step, and the pizza is assembled according to your exact specifications.

/**
 * Explanation:
 * 1. **Builder Class**:
 *    - The `PizzaBuilder` class encapsulates the construction logic for a `Pizza` object.
 *    - Each method sets a property and returns `this` to allow method chaining.
 *
 * 2. **Final Product**:
 *    - The `Pizza` class is the final product. It is constructed using the builder and stores the configuration.
 *
 * 3. **Construction Process**:
 *    - You can specify only the properties you need. For example, if you donâ€™t want sauce, you can skip the `setSauce()` method.
 *    - The final object is created using the `build()` method, which returns a fully constructed `Pizza`.
 *
 * **Real-Life Analogy**:
 * Think of ordering a custom pizza. You tell the builder (the person making your pizza) the size, crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings
 * you want, and they assemble it step-by-step until you have the exact pizza you requested.
